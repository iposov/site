# Submission process

The submission process is relevant only for tasks starting from the second block.
All first tasks you submit anyway you like, either by email or whatsapp or Tg.

## Cocalc.com

Please register at [http://cocalc.com](http://cocalc.com) and send me somehow the email
you used to register. I will add you as a student to the course.

After I register you, you will see a project in a list of projects called like `mp-2020`.
There you will see folders called like `octave-indexing`, `octave-vectorization`. These
names are the same used in a list of tasks. Please find this names in our [list
of tasks](octave.md).

Each task should consist of one file. Each task has a name, it is written in the beginning
of the task,  the name is usually `task1`, `task2`, etc. Other names are rare. Please
find these names in our [list of tasks](octave.md). The name of the file is the same
as the task name plus the `.m` extension. For example, `task1.m`, `task2.m`, etc.

You should upload these files inside folders in you project. For example, upload `task1`
inside the folder `octave-indexing`. Please, remember, that these folders are created for
you, you don't need to create them by yourself.

After the deadline I will collect all your tasks from the certain folder, so you don't
need to notify me that you have uploaded your solutions.
