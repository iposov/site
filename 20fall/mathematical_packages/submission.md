## A folder for the semester

Please first create a folder to store all your work
during the semester. Take care of this folder, I hope it will stay at least during
the end of the semester and its data will not be lost.

You will create subfolders for each block of tasks. By a block of tasks I mean a set of tasks
that are united under the common title, such as "create matrices", "indexing", "vectorization" on
our tasks page: [our octave tasks](octave.md). The name of the folder to create is written near
the block title. So, by now you should create subfolders `octave-matrices`,
`octave-idexing`, `octave-vectorization`.

Then you will solve tasks from blocks. Each task should consist of one file, you put it
to the corresponding folder. Each task has a name,
it is written in the beginning
of the task,  the name is usually `task1`, `task2`, etc. Other names are rare.
The name of the file is the same
as the task name plus the `.m` extension. For example, `task1.m`, `task2.m`, etc.

So, your will have the following folder structure:

```
mathematical-packages-practice
├── octave-matrices
│   └── solutions.pdf or any other files that you sent me
├── octave-indexing
│   ├── task1.m
│   ├── task2.m
│   ├── task3.m
│   ├── task4.m
│   ├── filter_multiples.m
│   ├── seive.m
│   └── task6.m
└── octave-vectorization
    ├── task1.m
    ├── task2.m
    ├── task3.m
    ├── all2dets.m
    └── all_lines_intersections.m
```

The first block `octave-matrices` contains `solutions.pdf` instead of `.m` files because
in the beginning of the semester we used the other way to submit tasks.

## Cocalc.com

Please register at [http://cocalc.com](http://cocalc.com) and send me somehow the email
you used to register. I will add you as a student to the course.

After I register you, you will see a project in a list of projects called like `mp-2020`.
There you will see folders called the same way as our task blocks:
`octave-indexing`, `octave-vectorization`, etc.

You should synchronize your folder with the folders at the cocalc. It is possible to upload files
to cocalc, move them, rename, so you can work with them as with usual files. Those who have
an experience with SSH, could find instructions of how to work with cocalc through SSH
at the page of projects settings.

So you will now not need to send me files in messengers, you will upload them to cocalc. I will
check them there.
